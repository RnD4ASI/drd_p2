Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to identify which attributes are duplicates of each other based on their names and definitions. The attributes are listed with their IDs and names, and I need to check if any of them are duplicates.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a duplicate here. The problem states that two attributes are duplicates if they represent the same concept or similar semantic meaning, even if their names or definitions are different. So, for example, if there's an "ID" attribute and another "customer_id", they might be duplicates if they both refer to a unique identifier for the customer.

Looking at the list:

1. attr_1: ID (customer_id)
2. attr_2: ID (client_id)
3. attr_3: ID (user_identifier)
4. attr_22: first_name
5. attr_25: last_name

Wait, the first line says "ID: attr_1 | Name: customer_id | Definition: Unique identifier for the customer". So attr_1 is the ID, and the name is customer_id. Then attr_2 is ID, name client_id, definition unique identifier for client. Similarly, attr_3 is ID, name user_identifier, definition unique identifier for user. So attr_1, attr_2, attr_3 all have the same type (ID) but different names and definitions. The definitions are for different entities: customer, client, user. So they are different concepts, but the same type. But the problem says to consider duplicates if they represent the same concept. So if they are different concepts, they might not be duplicates. But maybe the definitions are similar in meaning. Wait, the definitions are "Unique identifier for the customer", "Unique identifier for the client", "Unique identifier for the user". These are different concepts. So attr_1, attr_2, attr_3 are different attributes, each for a different entity. So they are not duplicates of each other. But maybe the problem considers that they are all IDs, so they are duplicates in terms of being identifiers. But the definitions are different. So the question is whether they are duplicates based on their semantic meaning. If they are different entities, then they are not duplicates. So attr_1, attr_2, attr_3 are not duplicates of each other.

Then attr_22 is first_name, and attr_25 is last_name. These are both names of the customer, so they are duplicates of each other. So attr_22 and attr_25 are duplicates. So they should be in the same group.

So the duplicates would be attr_22 and attr_25. Let me check again. The definitions are "First name of the customer" and "Last name of the customer". These are two different attributes but both related to the customer's name. So they are duplicates. So they should be grouped together.

So the duplicates array would have two entries: one for attr_22 and attr_25. But wait, the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier. So if attr_22 and attr_25 are duplicates, they should be in the same group. So in the JSON, the group for both would be the same integer.

So the final JSON would have:

- attr_22 and attr_25 as duplicates, with group 1.

Other attributes (attr_1, attr_2, attr_3) are not duplicates of each other, so their group is null.

So the JSON structure would be:

{
  "duplicates": [
    {
      "id": "attr_22",
      "name": "first_name",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_25",
      "name": "last_name",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    }
  ]
}

Wait, but the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So if there are multiple duplicates, they all share the same group. So in this case, attr_22 and attr_25 are duplicates, so they are in group 1. The other attributes (attr_1, attr_2, attr_3) are not duplicates of any other, so their group is null.

So the final answer should be that the duplicates are attr_22 and attr_25, grouped under group 1. The other attributes are not duplicates, so their group is null.

I need to make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted with the correct keys and that the group is an integer. Also, the is_duplicate is true for the duplicates and false otherwise.
Answer:
```json
{
    "duplicates": [
        {
            "id": "attr_22",
            "name": "first_name",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_25",
            "name": "last_name",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        }
    ]
}
```
