Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to determine which of the two attributes, annual_salary or yearly_earnings, is better suited based on the given criteria. 

First, looking at the attributes:

Attribute 35: annual_salary with definition "Annual salary of the person."
Attribute 36: yearly_earnings with definition "Yearly earnings of the individual."

The task is to select the best one. The criteria are clear, descriptive names, comprehensive definitions, and consistency with industry standards.

Starting with the naming conventions. "Annual salary" and "yearly earnings" are both related, but the terms might be slightly different. "Annual" is commonly used in salary contexts, while "yearly" is more general. However, in business terms, "annual salary" is a standard term. "Yearly earnings" might be less common, but it's still acceptable. 

Next, the definitions. Both attributes define "yearly" or "annual" salary, but the exact terms might matter. "Annual salary" is more precise because it directly refers to the salary paid annually. "Yearly earnings" is a bit more vague, as "earnings" can include bonuses, commissions, etc., whereas "salary" is typically a fixed amount. However, the definition here is given as "Yearly earnings of the individual," which is a bit more general. 

Now, considering industry standards. In many industries, "annual salary" is the standard term used. For example, in the US, "annual salary" is commonly used in job descriptions. "Yearly earnings" might be less common, but it's still used. However, the term "salary" is more specific than "earnings," so "annual salary" is more precise.

Another point is the naming convention. "Annual salary" is more concise and follows standard naming conventions. "Yearly earnings" is a bit longer and might be less standard. 

So, even though both attributes are similar, "annual salary" is more precise and commonly used. Therefore, attr_35 is the better choice.
```json
{
    "best_attribute_id": "attr_35",
    "best_attribute": "annual_salary",
    "reasoning": "The attribute 'annual_salary' uses a clear, standard naming convention and is more precisely defined as the fixed amount paid annually, aligning with industry standards. 'Yearly earnings' is less specific and less commonly used than 'annual salary.'"
}
