Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to identify which attributes in the given list are duplicates of each other based on their names and definitions. The goal is to create a JSON object that shows which attributes are duplicates and assign them the same group number.

First, I need to look at each attribute and see if they represent the same concept. Let's list out the attributes again:

1. ID: attr_28 | Name: age | Definition: Age of the customer in years
2. ID: attr_29 | Name: years_old | Definition: How old the person is in years
3. ID: attr_30 | Name: customer_age | Definition: Age of the customer
4. ID: attr_31 | Name: gender | Definition: Gender of the customer
5. ID: attr_32 | Name: sex | Definition: Sex of the person
6. ID: attr_34 | Name: income | Definition: Annual income of the customer

Now, I need to check for duplicates. Let's go through each attribute and compare them.

Starting with attr_28: "age" and "years_old" both refer to the customer's age. The definitions are similar, just different wording. So attr_28 and attr_29 might be duplicates. But wait, attr_29 is "years_old" and attr_28 is "age". Are these considered duplicates? The problem says to consider if they represent the same concept. Since both are about age, they are duplicates. So attr_28 and attr_29 are duplicates. Let's note that.

Next, attr_30 is "customer_age" which is the same as attr_28's definition. So attr_30 is a duplicate of attr_28. But wait, attr_30's name is "customer_age", which is a bit different from "age" but the definition is the same. So attr_30 is a duplicate of attr_28. However, attr_28 and attr_29 are already duplicates. So attr_30 would be a duplicate of attr_28, which is already in group 1. So attr_30 would be in group 1 as well.

Then, attr_31 is "gender" and attr_32 is "sex". Both are about gender. The definitions are different, but the concepts are the same. So attr_31 and attr_32 are duplicates. They should be in the same group. Let's note that.

Attr_34 is "income", which is a different concept from the others. It's about annual income, which is a separate attribute. So attr_34 is not a duplicate of any other attribute.

So the duplicates are:

- attr_28 (age) and attr_29 (years_old) are duplicates (group 1)
- attr_30 (customer_age) is a duplicate of attr_28 (age), so group 1
- attr_31 (gender) and attr_32 (sex) are duplicates (group 2)
- attr_34 (income) is alone, group null

Wait, but the problem says that the group should be the same for all duplicates. So if attr_28, attr_29, and attr_30 are all duplicates, they should all be in group 1. But attr_30 is a duplicate of attr_28, which is already in group 1. So attr_30 would be in group 1. Then attr_28 and attr_29 are in group 1, and attr_30 is also in group 1. Then attr_31 and attr_32 are in group 2. So the duplicates array would have entries for group 1 and group 2.

But wait, the example given in the problem has three attributes with two duplicates. Let me check the example again. The example had attr_1, attr_2, and attr_3, where attr_1 and attr_2 are duplicates (group 1), and attr_3 is not. So in that case, the group is assigned to all duplicates.

So in our case, attr_28, attr_29, and attr_30 are all duplicates of each other. So they should all be in group 1. Then attr_31 and attr_32 are duplicates, so group 2. attr_34 is alone.

So the JSON should have:

- For group 1: attr_28, attr_29, attr_30
- For group 2: attr_31, attr_32
- attr_34 is not a duplicate, so group null.

But wait, attr_30's name is "customer_age" which is a bit different from "age", but the definition is the same. So attr_30 is a duplicate of attr_28. So attr_30 is in group 1 with attr_28 and attr_29.

So the duplicates array would have entries for each attribute. Let's structure it.

Each entry in the duplicates array has the id, name, is_duplicate, and group.

So:

- attr_28: is_duplicate: true, group: 1
- attr_29: is_duplicate: true, group: 1
- attr_30: is_duplicate: true, group: 1
- attr_31: is_duplicate: true, group: 2
- attr_32: is_duplicate: true, group: 2
- attr_34: is_duplicate: false, group: null

But wait, attr_30 is a duplicate of attr_28, which is already in group 1. So attr_30's group is 1. Similarly, attr_28 and attr_29 are in group 1.

So the JSON would look like:

{
  "duplicates": [
    {
      "id": "attr_28",
      "name": "age",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_29",
      "name": "years_old",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_30",
      "name": "customer_age",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_31",
      "name": "gender",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_32",
      "name": "sex",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_34",
      "name": "income",
      "is_duplicate": false,
      "group": null
    }
  ]
}

But wait, the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So if two attributes are duplicates, they are in the same group. So attr_28, attr_29, and attr_30 are all in group 1. Then attr_31 and attr_32 are in group 2. attr_34 is not a duplicate, so group null.

Yes, that's correct. So the JSON should have these entries. Each duplicate entry has the same group. The group is 1 for the first three, 2 for the next two, and null for attr_34.

I think that's the correct approach. Let me double-check if there are any other duplicates I missed. For example, attr_30's name is "customer_age" which is similar to "age", but the definition is the same. So yes, it's a duplicate. attr_31 and attr_32 are gender and sex, which are the same concept. So they are duplicates. No other attributes are duplicates. So the JSON should be as above.
Answer:
```json
{
    "duplicates": [
        {
            "id": "attr_28",
            "name": "age",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_29",
            "name": "years_old",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_30",
            "name": "customer_age",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_31",
            "name": "gender",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 2
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_32",
            "name": "sex",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 2
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_34",
            "name": "income",
            "is_duplicate": false,
            "group": null
        }
    ]
}
