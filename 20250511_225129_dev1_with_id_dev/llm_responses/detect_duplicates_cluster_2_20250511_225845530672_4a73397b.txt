Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine which of the given attributes are duplicates of each other based on their names and definitions. The goal is to group them into duplicates or not, using the same group ID for all duplicates.

First, let me list out all the attributes and their details:

1. attr_13: ID (Name: customer_id, Definition: Email address of the customer)
Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first line says:

1. ID: attr_13 | Name: email_address | Definition: Email address of the customer

Wait, maybe I need to parse this correctly. Let me re-express each attribute:

Looking at the original data:

1. ID: attr_13 | Name: email_address | Definition: Email address of the customer
2. ID: attr_14 | Name: contact_email | Definition: Email contact information
3. ID: attr_15 | Name: electronic_mail | Definition: Electronic mail address for communication
4. ID: attr_16 | Name: phone_number | Definition: Phone number of the customer
5. ID: attr_17 | Name: contact_phone | Definition: Phone contact information
6. ID: attr_18 | Name: telephone | Definition: Telephone number for communication

Wait, the first line is:

1. ID: attr_13 | Name: email_address | Definition: Email address of the customer

So, each line has ID, Name, and Definition. So, the attributes are:

attr_13: Name is email_address, Definition is Email address of the customer.

attr_14: Name is contact_email, Definition: Email contact information.

attr_15: Name is electronic_mail, Definition: Electronic mail address for communication.

attr_16: Name is phone_number, Definition: Phone number of the customer.

attr_17: Name is contact_phone, Definition: Phone contact information.

attr_18: Name is telephone, Definition: Telephone number for communication.

Now, the task is to check if any of these attributes are duplicates. The key is to see if they represent the same concept, even if the names or definitions are different.

Looking at the definitions:

- email_address: Email address of the customer.

- contact_email: Email contact information.

- electronic_mail: Electronic mail address for communication.

- phone_number: Phone number of the customer.

- contact_phone: Phone contact information.

- telephone: Telephone number for communication.

So, all these are about contact information, either email or phone. The definitions are similar, but the names are different. For example, "email_address" and "contact_email" both refer to email, but "electronic_mail" is a bit different in wording. However, the definitions are very similar. Similarly, "phone_number" and "contact_phone" are both about phone numbers. "Telephone" is a bit more general, but it's similar to phone number.

So, the main idea is that all these attributes are about contact information, either email or phone. So, they are duplicates of each other.

But wait, the problem says that duplicates are attributes that represent the same concept or similar semantic meaning. So, even if they have different names, if they are about the same thing, they are duplicates.

So, for example, "email_address" and "contact_email" are duplicates. Similarly, "phone_number" and "contact_phone" are duplicates. "telephone" and "phone_number" might be considered duplicates, but "telephone" is a bit more general. However, in the context of customer contact info, they are similar.

But the problem is that the definitions are very similar. So, all these attributes are duplicates of each other. So, they are all in the same group.

But wait, the first attribute is attr_13 with name "email_address" and definition "Email address of the customer". The second is attr_14 with name "contact_email" and definition "Email contact information". The third is "electronic_mail" with definition "Electronic mail address for communication". The fourth is "phone_number" with definition "Phone number of the customer". The fifth is "contact_phone" with definition "Phone contact information". The sixth is "telephone" with definition "Telephone number for communication".

So, all of these are about contact information. So, they are all duplicates of each other. Therefore, each of these attributes is a duplicate of the others. But how to group them?

The problem says that if two attributes are duplicates, they should be in the same group. So, for example, attr_13 and attr_14 are duplicates, attr_13 and attr_15 are duplicates, etc. But if all of them are duplicates, then they should be in the same group.

But the problem is that the user wants to group them into duplicates. So, for example, if attr_13 is a duplicate of attr_14, attr_15, attr_16, attr_17, and attr_18, then all of them would be in the same group.

But how to determine which ones are duplicates. Let's check each pair.

First, attr_13 (email_address) and attr_14 (contact_email): same concept, so duplicates.

attr_13 and attr_15 (electronic_mail): same concept, duplicates.

attr_13 and attr_16 (phone_number): same concept, duplicates.

attr_13 and attr_17 (contact_phone): same concept, duplicates.

attr_13 and attr_18 (telephone): same concept, duplicates.

Similarly, attr_14 (contact_email) and attr_15 (electronic_mail): same concept, duplicates.

attr_14 and attr_16 (phone_number): same concept, duplicates.

attr_14 and attr_17 (contact_phone): same concept, duplicates.

attr_14 and attr_18 (telephone): same concept, duplicates.

attr_15 (electronic_mail) and attr_16 (phone_number): same concept, duplicates.

attr_15 and attr_17 (contact_phone): same concept, duplicates.

attr_15 and attr_18 (telephone): same concept, duplicates.

attr_16 (phone_number) and attr_17 (contact_phone): same concept, duplicates.

attr_16 and attr_18 (telephone): same concept, duplicates.

attr_17 (contact_phone) and attr_18 (telephone): same concept, duplicates.

So, all attributes are duplicates of each other. Therefore, all of them are in the same group.

But the problem is that the user wants to group them into duplicates. So, the duplicates array would have all attributes as duplicates, but with the same group ID.

But the example given in the problem has 3 attributes with 2 duplicates. So, in that example, two attributes are duplicates, and the third is not. So, in our case, all 6 attributes are duplicates of each other. Therefore, the group ID would be 1 for all of them.

But wait, the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So, if all attributes are duplicates, then they are all in group 1.

But let me check again. Are all attributes duplicates of each other?

Yes, because all are about contact information (email or phone). So, they are all duplicates. Therefore, the JSON should have all 6 attributes as duplicates, grouped under group 1.

But the example given in the problem has 3 attributes where two are duplicates. So, in our case, all 6 are duplicates. So, the duplicates array would have 6 entries, each with is_duplicate: true, and group: 1.

But the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So, if all are duplicates, then group is 1.

So, the final JSON would be:

{
  "duplicates": [
    {
      "id": "attr_13",
      "name": "email_address",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_14",
      "name": "contact_email",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_15",
      "name": "electronic_mail",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_16",
      "name": "phone_number",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_17",
      "name": "contact_phone",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_18",
      "name": "telephone",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    }
  ]
}

But wait, the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So, if all are duplicates, then group is 1. But in the example, the group is 1 for all duplicates. So, this seems correct.

But I need to make sure that all attributes are considered duplicates. For example, "telephone" and "phone_number" are both about phone numbers. So, they are duplicates. Similarly, "contact_phone" and "phone_number" are duplicates. So, yes, all are duplicates.

Therefore, the final answer is as above.
Answer:
```json
{
  "duplicates": [
