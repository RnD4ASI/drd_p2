Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine which of the given attributes are duplicates of each other based on their names and definitions. The attributes are:

1. ID: attr_7 | Name: product_category | Definition: Category of the product
2. ID: attr_8 | Name: item_type | Definition: Type of the item
3. ID: attr_9 | Name: product_classification | Definition: Classification of the product

First, I need to understand what each attribute represents. 

Looking at the definitions:
- attr_7's definition is "Category of the product," which sounds like a classification or a type of the product.
- attr_8's definition is "Type of the item," which is more about the specific kind or category of the item.
- attr_9's definition is "Classification of the product," which is similar to the first one but maybe more general.

Now, the task is to see if any of these attributes are duplicates. Duplicates are attributes that represent the same concept or similar semantic meaning, even if their names or definitions are different.

Let me compare each pair:

- attr_7 (product_category) and attr_9 (product_classification): Both are about classification of the product. "Category" and "classification" might be related, but are they the same? For example, product category could be a classification, but classification could be a broader term. However, in some contexts, they might be considered similar. So maybe attr_7 and attr_9 are duplicates.

- attr_8 (item_type) and attr_7 (product_category): "Item type" is a type of the item, while "product category" is a classification. They might be related but not exactly the same. For example, an item could be a type (like a book) or a category (like electronics). So they might not be duplicates.

- attr_8 (item_type) and attr_9 (product_classification): "Item type" is about the type of the item, while "product classification" is about the classification of the product. These could be similar but not exactly the same. For instance, a product's classification might be a category, but the item type is more about the specific kind.

So, the only possible duplicates are attr_7 and attr_9. They both relate to classification of the product, even though their definitions are slightly different. Therefore, they should be considered duplicates.

Now, the group identifier. Since they are duplicates, they should be in the same group. The problem says to use an integer group identifier like 1, 2, etc. Let's assign group 1 to them.

So the JSON should have two entries: attr_7 and attr_9 as duplicates with group 1. attr_8 is not a duplicate, so its group is null.

Let me check again. Are there any other possible duplicates? For example, attr_8 and attr_9? No, because "item type" is about the type of the item, while "product classification" is about the classification of the product. They are different concepts. So only attr_7 and attr_9 are duplicates.

Therefore, the final JSON should have two entries in the duplicates array, both with group 1, and attr_8 with group null.
Answer:
```json
{
    "duplicates": [
        {
            "id": "attr_7",
            "name": "product_category",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_9",
            "name": "product_classification",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_8",
            "name": "item_type",
            "is_duplicate": false,
            "group": null
        }
    ]
}
```
