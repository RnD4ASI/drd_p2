                "best_attribute": "product_category",
                "reasoning": "The 'product_category' attribute has a clear, descriptive name that follows standard naming conventions. It provides a comprehensive definition of the product's category, which aligns with industry standards for product classification. 'product_classification' is less specific and more general, making 'product_category' the more precise and appropriate choice."
            }
