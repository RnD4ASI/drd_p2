Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look at the list of attributes provided and see which ones might be duplicates based on their names and definitions. The goal is to determine if any attributes are duplicates of each other, even if their names or definitions are different.

Looking at the attributes:

1. attr_40: ID, Name: attribute_3, Definition: Definition for attribute_3
2. attr_41: ID, Name: attribute_4, Definition: Definition for attribute_4
3. attr_43: ID, Name: attribute_6, Definition: Definition for attribute_6
4. attr_48: ID, Name: attribute_11, Definition: Definition for attribute_11
5. attr_50: ID, Name: attribute_13, Definition: Definition for attribute_13
6. attr_51: ID, Name: attribute_14, Definition: Definition for attribute_14
7. attr_54: ID, Name: attribute_17, Definition: Definition for attribute_17
8. attr_55: ID, Name: attribute_18, Definition: Definition for attribute_18
9. attr_58: ID, Name: attribute_21, Definition: Definition for attribute_21
10. attr_61: ID, Name: attribute_24, Definition: Definition for attribute_24
11. attr_64: ID, Name: attribute_27, Definition: Definition for attribute_27
12. attr_65: ID, Name: attribute_28, Definition: Definition for attribute_28
13. attr_70: ID, Name: attribute_33, Definition: Definition for attribute_33
14. attr_79: ID, Name: attribute_42, Definition: Definition for attribute_42
15. attr_80: ID, Name: attribute_43, Definition: Definition for attribute_43
16. attr_83: ID, Name: attribute_46, Definition: Definition for attribute_46
17. attr_86: ID, Name: attribute_49, Definition: Definition for attribute_49
18. attr_90: ID, Name: attribute_53, Definition: Definition for attribute_53
19. attr_91: ID, Name: attribute_54, Definition: Definition for attribute_54
20. attr_99: ID, Name: attribute_62, Definition: Definition for attribute_62
21. attr_100: ID, Name: attribute_63, Definition: Definition for attribute_63

First, I need to check if any of these attributes have similar names or definitions. Let's go through them one by one.

Looking at the names:

- attr_40: ID, Name: attribute_3
- attr_41: ID, Name: attribute_4
- attr_43: ID, Name: attribute_6
- attr_48: ID, Name: attribute_11
- attr_50: ID, Name: attribute_13
- attr_51: ID, Name: attribute_14
- attr_54: ID, Name: attribute_17
- attr_55: ID, Name: attribute_18
- attr_58: ID, Name: attribute_21
- attr_61: ID, Name: attribute_24
- attr_64: ID, Name: attribute_27
- attr_65: ID, Name: attribute_28
- attr_70: ID, Name: attribute_33
- attr_79: ID, Name: attribute_42
- attr_80: ID, Name: attribute_43
- attr_83: ID, Name: attribute_46
- attr_86: ID, Name: attribute_49
- attr_90: ID, Name: attribute_53
- attr_91: ID, Name: attribute_54
- attr_99: ID, Name: attribute_62
- attr_100: ID, Name: attribute_63

Wait, I notice that attr_80 and attr_83 have the same name "attribute_43" and "attribute_46" respectively. But looking at the names, attr_80 is "attribute_43" and attr_83 is "attribute_46". So they are different. But maybe there's a pattern here. Let me check if any of these have similar names.

Looking at the names:

- attribute_3, attribute_4, attribute_6, attribute_11, attribute_13, attribute_14, attribute_17, attribute_18, attribute_21, attribute_24, attribute_27, attribute_28, attribute_33, attribute_42, attribute_43, attribute_46, attribute_49, attribute_53, attribute_54, attribute_62, attribute_63.

Wait, the names are all in the format "attribute_x", where x is a number. So, for example, attribute_3, attribute_4, etc. Now, looking for duplicates in these names. Are there any names that are the same? Let's check:

- attribute_3, attribute_4, attribute_6, attribute_11, attribute_13, attribute_14, attribute_17, attribute_18, attribute_21, attribute_24, attribute_27, attribute_28, attribute_33, attribute_42, attribute_43, attribute_46, attribute_49, attribute_53, attribute_54, attribute_62, attribute_63.

Looking at these, I don't see any duplicates in the names. Each is unique. So, the names are all different. But maybe the definitions are similar? Let's check the definitions.

The definitions are:

- attr_40: Definition for attribute_3
- attr_41: Definition for attribute_4
- attr_43: Definition for attribute_6
- attr_48: Definition for attribute_11
- attr_50: Definition for attribute_13
- attr_51: Definition for attribute_14
- attr_54: Definition for attribute_17
- attr_55: Definition for attribute_18
- attr_58: Definition for attribute_21
- attr_61: Definition for attribute_24
- attr_64: Definition for attribute_27
- attr_65: Definition for attribute_28
- attr_70: Definition for attribute_33
- attr_79: Definition for attribute_42
- attr_80: Definition for attribute_43
- attr_83: Definition for attribute_46
- attr_86: Definition for attribute_49
- attr_90: Definition for attribute_53
- attr_91: Definition for attribute_54
- attr_99: Definition for attribute_62
- attr_100: Definition for attribute_63

Wait, here's a key point. For example, attr_80 has the definition "Definition for attribute_43", and attr_83 has "Definition for attribute_46". But attr_80's name is "attribute_43" and attr_83's name is "attribute_46". So, the definitions are for different attributes. But maybe there's a pattern here. Let me check if any of these definitions are similar.

Looking at the definitions, they are all unique. For example, attr_40's definition is "Definition for attribute_3", attr_41's is "Definition for attribute_4", etc. So each definition is unique. Therefore, the definitions don't seem to be duplicates.

Wait, but maybe the names of the attributes are similar. For example, "attribute_3" and "attribute_4" are different, but maybe there's a pattern where some attributes have similar names. However, looking at the list, each name is unique. So, the names are all different.

But wait, the problem says that two attributes are duplicates if they represent the same concept or similar semantic meaning. So even if the names are different, if they have the same meaning, they are duplicates.

So, for example, if "attribute_3" and "attribute_4" are both about the same thing, they would be duplicates. But in this case, the names are all different. So, the names are unique, but maybe the definitions are similar?

Wait, looking at the definitions again. For example, attr_40's definition is "Definition for attribute_3", which is the same as the name of the attribute. So, the definition is the same as the name of the attribute. But that's not helpful. Wait, no. The definition is "Definition for attribute_3", which is the same as the name of the attribute. So, the definition is the same as the name. But that's not helpful for determining duplicates.

Alternatively, maybe the definitions are for different attributes. For example, attr_40's definition is "Definition for attribute_3
