Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look at the attributes provided and see which ones might be duplicates based on their names and definitions.

Looking at the list:

1. ID: attr_23 | Name: given_name | Definition: Given name of the person
2. ID: attr_24 | Name: forename | Definition: Forename of the individual
3. ID: attr_26 | Name: surname | Definition: Surname of the person
4. ID: attr_27 | Name: family_name | Definition: Family name of the individual
5. ID: attr_33 | Name: gender_identity | Definition: Gender identity of the individual
6. ID: attr_35 | Name: annual_salary | Definition: Annual salary of the person
7. ID: attr_36 | Name: yearly_earnings | Definition: Yearly earnings of the individual

First, I notice that "given_name" and "forename" are both names, but they might be considered duplicates. However, in some contexts, "forename" is a synonym for "given name," so they could be duplicates. But I need to check if they are considered the same in this case. The definitions are similar, so maybe they are duplicates.

Next, "surname" and "family_name" are both related to the family name. The definition for surname is "Surname of the person" and family_name is "Family name of the individual." These are similar, so they might be duplicates. However, sometimes "surname" is used more broadly, but in this context, they seem to be the same.

Then, "gender_identity" is a unique attribute since it's about gender identity, not a name or a salary.

"Annual_salary" and "yearly_earnings" both refer to salary, but "annual_salary" is more commonly used in databases, while "yearly_earnings" is a bit more specific. However, they might be considered duplicates since they both refer to the same concept. But I need to check if they are considered the same in this context. If they are both about annual earnings, they might be duplicates.

So, the duplicates would be:

- attr_23 (given_name) and attr_24 (forename) as duplicates.
- attr_26 (surname) and attr_27 (family_name) as duplicates.
- attr_35 (annual_salary) and attr_36 (yearly_earnings) as duplicates.

But wait, the problem says to assign the same group ID to all duplicates. So, if there are multiple duplicates, they should all be in the same group. For example, if attr_23 and attr_24 are duplicates, and attr_26 and attr_27 are duplicates, and attr_35 and attr_36 are duplicates, then each of these pairs would be in their own group. However, the example given in the problem has three attributes with two duplicates in one group. So, maybe the answer is that each pair is in their own group.

But the problem says to assign the same group ID to all duplicates. So, if there are multiple duplicates, they need to be in the same group. However, the example shows that if two pairs are duplicates, they are in separate groups. Wait, the example has three attributes where two are duplicates (attr_1 and attr_2) and the third is not. So, the group is 1 for the two duplicates.

So, in this case, the duplicates would be:

Group 1: attr_23 (given_name), attr_24 (forename)
Group 2: attr_26 (surname), attr_27 (family_name)
Group 3: attr_35 (annual_salary), attr_36 (yearly_earnings)

But the problem says to assign the same group ID to all duplicates. So, if there are multiple groups, each group has its own ID. However, the example shows that each group is a separate entry. So, the answer would have three groups, each with their own group ID.

But the user's example shows that if two pairs are duplicates, they are in separate groups. So, in this case, the answer would have three groups.

But let me check again. The problem says "assign the same duplicate_group_id to all attributes that are duplicates of each other." So, if two attributes are duplicates, they are in the same group. So, if attr_23 and attr_24 are duplicates, they are in group 1. Similarly, attr_26 and attr_27 are in group 2, and attr_35 and attr_36 are in group 3.

So, the JSON would have three entries, each with their own group ID.

But the user's example has three attributes with two duplicates in one group. So, in this case, the answer would have three groups.

But the problem says to return the duplicates array with each entry. So, the final JSON would have three entries, each with their own group.

But I need to make sure that each duplicate pair is in their own group. So, the answer would be:

{
  "duplicates": [
    {
      "id": "attr_23",
      "name": "given_name",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_24",
      "name": "forename",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_26",
      "name": "surname",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_27",
      "name": "family_name",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_35",
      "name": "annual_salary",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 3
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_36",
      "name": "yearly_earnings",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 3
    }
  ]
}

But wait, the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So, each group is a separate integer. So, in this case, group 1, 2, 3.

But the user's example has three attributes with two duplicates in one group. So, the answer here would have three groups.

But the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So, each group is a separate integer. Therefore, the answer would have three groups, each with their own group ID.

So, the final JSON would have these entries.
Answer:
```json
{
  "duplicates": [
    {
      "id": "attr_23",
      "name": "given_name",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_24",
      "name": "forename",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_26",
      "name": "surname",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_27",
      "name": "family_name",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_35",
      "name": "annual_salary",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 3
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_36",
      "name": "yearly_earnings",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 3
    }
  ]
}
```
