Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine which attributes are duplicates of each other based on their names and definitions. The attributes are:

1. ID: attr_10 | Name: timestamp | Definition: Time when the event occurred
2. ID: attr_11 | Name: event_time | Definition: Time when the event took place
3. ID: attr_12 | Name: transaction_datetime | Definition: Date and time of the transaction

First, I should look at the names and definitions to see if they are similar. 

Starting with attr_10: Name is "timestamp" and Definition is "Time when the event occurred". Then attr_11 has Name "event_time" and Definition "Time when the event took place". These seem similar, both referring to the time of an event. The difference is in the wording, but the core meaning is the same. So attr_10 and attr_11 might be duplicates.

Next, attr_12 has Name "transaction_datetime" and Definition "Date and time of the transaction". The definition here is more specific, mentioning both date and time. The other attributes are about event time, which might be a subset of transaction time. However, "transaction_datetime" is a more specific term, but the other attributes are about event time. Wait, but the definitions are "Time when the event occurred" and "Time when the event took place" which are similar to "event_time". So maybe attr_12 is a more specific version of the transaction time, but the other two are about event time. 

But the problem says to check if they are duplicates. So if attr_12 is about transaction datetime, which includes both date and time, but the other two are about event time. Are they duplicates? The definitions are different. The first two are about event time, and the third is about transaction datetime. So maybe attr_12 is not a duplicate of the others. 

Wait, but the definitions: "transaction_datetime" is "Date and time of the transaction". So that's more specific. But the other attributes are about event time. So maybe attr_12 is not a duplicate of the others. 

So, attr_10 and attr_11 are duplicates because they both refer to the time of the event. attr_12 is a different attribute, referring to the transaction's datetime. So there's no duplication between attr_12 and the others. 

Therefore, the duplicates would be attr_10 and attr_11, grouped under the same group. The third attribute is not a duplicate of any other, so its group is null. 

So the JSON should have two entries for duplicates: attr_10 and attr_11 as duplicates, and attr_12 as not a duplicate. 

Wait, but the problem says to assign the same group to all duplicates. So the group number is the same for all duplicates. Let's assign group 1 to the duplicates. 

So the final JSON would be:

{
  "duplicates": [
    {
      "id": "attr_10",
      "name": "timestamp",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_11",
      "name": "event_time",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_12",
      "name": "transaction_datetime",
      "is_duplicate": false,
      "group": null
    }
  ]
}

Yes, that seems right. The first two are duplicates, the third is not. The group for the duplicates is 1. The third attribute's group is null because it's not a duplicate.
Answer:
```json
{
  "duplicates": [
    {
      "id": "attr_10",
      "name": "timestamp",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_11",
      "name": "event_time",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_12",
      "name": "transaction_datetime",
      "is_duplicate": false,
      "group": null
    }
  ]
}
```
