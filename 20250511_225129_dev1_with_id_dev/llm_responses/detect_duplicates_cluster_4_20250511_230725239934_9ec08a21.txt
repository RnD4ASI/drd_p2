Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look at all the attributes provided and see which ones are duplicates based on their names and definitions. The goal is to group duplicates into the same group number and mark them as duplicates.

Looking at the list:

1. attr_37: ID, Name: attribute_0, Definition: Definition for attribute_0
2. attr_38: ID, Name: attribute_1, Definition: Definition for attribute_1
3. attr_39: ID, Name: attribute_2, Definition: Definition for attribute_2
4. attr_42: ID, Name: attribute_5, Definition: Definition for attribute_5
5. attr_44: ID, Name: attribute_7, Definition: Definition for attribute_7
6. attr_45: ID, Name: attribute_8, Definition: Definition for attribute_8
7. attr_46: ID, Name: attribute_9, Definition: Definition for attribute_9
8. attr_47: ID, Name: attribute_10, Definition: Definition for attribute_10
9. attr_49: ID, Name: attribute_12, Definition: Definition for attribute_12
10. attr_52: ID, Name: attribute_15, Definition: Definition for attribute_15
11. attr_53: ID, Name: attribute_16, Definition: Definition for attribute_16
12. attr_56: ID, Name: attribute_19, Definition: Definition for attribute_19
13. attr_57: ID, Name: attribute_20, Definition: Definition for attribute_20
14. attr_59: ID, Name: attribute_22, Definition: Definition for attribute_22
15. attr_60: ID, Name: attribute_23, Definition: Definition for attribute_23
16. attr_62: ID, Name: attribute_25, Definition: Definition for attribute_25
17. attr_63: ID, Name: attribute_26, Definition: Definition for attribute_26
18. attr_66: ID, Name: attribute_29, Definition: Definition for attribute_29
19. attr_67: ID, Name: attribute_30, Definition: Definition for attribute_30
20. attr_68: ID, Name: attribute_31, Definition: Definition for attribute_31
21. attr_69: ID, Name: attribute_32, Definition: Definition for attribute_32
22. attr_71: ID, Name: attribute_34, Definition: Definition for attribute_34
23. attr_72: ID, Name: attribute_35, Definition: Definition for attribute_35
24. attr_73: ID, Name: attribute_36, Definition: Definition for attribute_36
25. attr_74: ID, Name: attribute_37, Definition: Definition for attribute_37
26. attr_75: ID, Name: attribute_38, Definition: Definition for attribute_38
27. attr_76: ID, Name: attribute_39, Definition: Definition for attribute_39
28. attr_77: ID, Name: attribute_40, Definition: Definition for attribute_40
29. attr_78: ID, Name: attribute_41, Definition: Definition for attribute_41
30. attr_81: ID, Name: attribute_44, Definition: Definition for attribute_44
31. attr_82: ID, Name: attribute_45, Definition: Definition for attribute_45
32. attr_84: ID, Name: attribute_47, Definition: Definition for attribute_47
33. attr_85: ID, Name: attribute_48, Definition: Definition for attribute_48
34. attr_87: ID, Name: attribute_50, Definition: Definition for attribute_50
35. attr_88: ID, Name: attribute_51, Definition: Definition for attribute_51
36. attr_89: ID, Name: attribute_52, Definition: Definition for attribute_52
37. attr_92: ID, Name: attribute_55, Definition: Definition for attribute_55
38. attr_93: ID, Name: attribute_56, Definition: Definition for attribute_56
39. attr_94: ID, Name: attribute_57, Definition: Definition for attribute_57
40. attr_95: ID, Name: attribute_58, Definition: Definition for attribute_58
41. attr_96: ID, Name: attribute_59, Definition: Definition for attribute_59
42. attr_97: ID, Name: attribute_60, Definition: Definition for attribute_60
43. attr_98: ID, Name: attribute_61, Definition: Definition for attribute_61

First, I notice that attr_37 and attr_74 have the same ID and Name, but different definitions. Wait, no, attr_37 is ID: attr_37, Name: attribute_37, Definition: Definition for attribute_37. Wait, looking back, the first entry is ID: attr_37 | Name: attribute_0 | Definition: Definition for attribute_0. Wait, the first line is:

1. ID: attr_37 | Name: attribute_0 | Definition: Definition for attribute_0

So attr_37's name is attribute_0, and its definition is Definition for attribute_0. Then attr_74 is ID: attr_74 | Name: attribute_37 | Definition: Definition for attribute_37. So attr_74's name is attribute_37, and definition is Definition for attribute_37. So attr_37 and attr_74 are different attributes with the same name and definition. Wait, but their IDs are different. So they are different attributes. But their names are attribute_0 and attribute_37, which are different. So they are not duplicates.

Wait, but the problem says to check if they are duplicates based on the same concept. So if two attributes have the same name and definition, even if they have different IDs, they are duplicates. But in this case, attr_37's name is attribute_0, and attr_74's name is attribute_37. So they are different names. So they are not duplicates.

But maybe there's another pattern. Let's check for other attributes.

Looking at attr_37 and attr_74: they have the same definition but different names. So they are not duplicates. Similarly, attr_38 and attr_75: attr_38's name is attribute_1, attr_75's name is attribute_38. So different names. So not duplicates.

Wait, but maybe the names are similar. For example, attr_37 is attribute_0, attr_38 is attribute_1, etc. So each attribute has a unique name. So if two attributes have the same name, they are duplicates. But in the list, all the names are unique. For example, attr_37's name is attribute_0, attr_38's name is attribute_1, etc. So each name is unique. Therefore, no duplicates in terms of names. But the problem says to check if they are duplicates based on the same concept or similar semantic meaning, even if different names or definitions.

So, for example, if two attributes have the same definition, even if different names, they might be duplicates. Let's check.

Looking at the definitions:

attr_37: Definition for attribute_0

attr_74: Definition for attribute_37

attr_38: Definition for attribute_1

attr_75: Definition for attribute_38

So attr_37 and attr_74 have definitions for different attributes. So they are not duplicates.

But maybe there's another pattern. Let's check if any attributes have the same definition. For example, attr_37's definition is "Definition for attribute_0", attr_38's is "Definition for attribute_1", etc. So each definition is unique. So no duplicates in definitions.

Wait, but maybe the definitions are similar. For example, attr_37's definition is "Definition for attribute_0", and attr_38's is "Definition for attribute_1". They are different. So no duplicates there.

So, if all the attributes have unique names and unique definitions, then there are no duplicates. But the problem says to check if they are duplicates based on the same concept or similar semantic meaning. So maybe there's a pattern I'm missing.

Wait, looking at the IDs. For example, attr_37 is ID: attr_37, attr_74 is ID: attr_74. So they are different. But maybe the names are related. For example, attr_37 is attribute_0, attr_74 is attribute_37. So the names are different. But maybe the definitions are related. For example, attr_37's
