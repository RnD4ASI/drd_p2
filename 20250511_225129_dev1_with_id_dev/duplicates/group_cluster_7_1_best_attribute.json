    "reasoning": "The 'address' attribute has a clear, descriptive name that follows standard naming conventions, a precise definition of 'Physical address of the customer', and is consistent with industry practices where physical addresses are critical for customer data. 'Location' is more general and less specific, making 'address' the better choice."
