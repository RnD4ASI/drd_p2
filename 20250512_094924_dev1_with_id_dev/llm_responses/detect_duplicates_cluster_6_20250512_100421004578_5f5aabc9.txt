Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine which attributes are duplicates of each other based on their names and definitions. The goal is to group them into duplicates or not, using the same group ID for all duplicates.

First, let me list out all the attributes provided:

1. attr_28: ID, Name: age, Definition: Age of the customer in years
2. attr_29: ID, Name: years_old, Definition: How old the person is in years
3. attr_30: ID, Name: customer_age, Definition: Age of the customer
4. attr_31: ID, Name: gender, Definition: Gender of the customer
5. attr_32: ID, Name: sex, Definition: Sex of the person
6. attr_34: ID, Name: income, Definition: Annual income of the customer

Now, I need to check if any of these attributes have the same meaning or are duplicates. Let's go through each one.

Starting with attr_28: Name is "age" and definition is "Age of the customer in years." Then attr_29 has "years_old" and the same definition. These are similar, both referring to the customer's age. So, attr_28 and attr_29 are duplicates. They both represent the same concept, just different names. So, they should be grouped together.

Next, attr_30: Name is "customer_age" and definition is the same as attr_28. This seems like a duplicate of attr_28. But wait, attr_30's name is "customer_age," which is a bit different from "age" or "years_old." However, the definition is the same. So, attr_30 is a duplicate of attr_28. But wait, attr_28 and attr_29 are already duplicates. So, attr_30 would be a duplicate of attr_28 and attr_29? Or is attr_30 a separate duplicate?

Wait, the problem says that duplicates are attributes that represent the same concept. So, if attr_30's definition is the same as attr_28, then attr_30 is a duplicate of attr_28. But attr_28 and attr_29 are already duplicates. So, attr_30 would be a duplicate of attr_28 and attr_29. But then, attr_30's name is "customer_age," which is different from "age" or "years_old." However, the definition is the same. So, the key is the definition. If the definition is the same, then the attributes are duplicates regardless of the name.

So, attr_28, attr_29, and attr_30 all have the same definition. Therefore, they are all duplicates of each other. But wait, attr_28 and attr_29 are duplicates, and attr_30 is a duplicate of both. So, they would all be in the same group.

Then, attr_31 is "gender" and attr_32 is "sex." These are different attributes. "Gender" is a more general term, while "sex" is a specific term. However, in some contexts, they might be considered the same. But in data attributes, "gender" and "sex" are often considered different. For example, "gender" could be a categorical variable with options like Male, Female, etc., while "sex" might refer to the biological sex. However, in some cases, they might be treated as the same. But the problem says to consider if they represent the same concept. If they are different, then they are not duplicates. So, attr_31 and attr_32 are not duplicates.

Then, attr_34 is "income," which is a different concept from the others. It's about annual income, which is a financial measure. So, it's not a duplicate of any other attribute here.

So, the duplicates would be:

- attr_28, attr_29, attr_30 are all duplicates of each other.

- attr_31 and attr_32 are not duplicates.

- attr_34 is not a duplicate.

So, the group ID for the duplicates would be 1, 2, 3, etc. Let me check the example given. In the example, the group ID was 1 for the two duplicates. So, if there are three attributes that are duplicates, they would all be in group 1.

So, the JSON should have three entries for the duplicates (attr_28, attr_29, attr_30) with group 1, and the others as not duplicates.

Wait, but attr_30 is a duplicate of attr_28 and attr_29. So, all three are duplicates. So, in the JSON, they would all be in the same group.

So, the final JSON would have:

- attr_28, attr_29, attr_30 as duplicates with group 1.

- attr_31 and attr_32 as not duplicates, so their group is null.

- attr_34 is not a duplicate, so group is null.

But the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So, for the duplicates, the group is the same integer. So, the duplicates are attr_28, attr_29, attr_30, all in group 1.

So, the JSON would look like:

{
  "duplicates": [
    {
      "id": "attr_28",
      "name": "age",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_29",
      "name": "years_old",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_30",
      "name": "customer_age",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_31",
      "name": "gender",
      "is_duplicate": false,
      "group": null
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_32",
      "name": "sex",
      "is_duplicate": false,
      "group": null
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_34",
      "name": "income",
      "is_duplicate": false,
      "group": null
    }
  ]
}

Wait, but the example shows that the group is an integer. So, the group is 1 for the three duplicates. The other attributes have group null. So, that's correct.

But I need to make sure that the group is assigned correctly. The problem says that if an attribute is not a duplicate, set the group to null. So, the three duplicates are in group 1, and the others are null.

Yes, that's correct. So, the JSON should have those three entries in the duplicates array, each with group 1, and the others with group null.
Answer:
```json
{
    "duplicates": [
        {
            "id": "attr_28",
            "name": "age",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_29",
            "name": "years_old",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_30",
            "name": "customer_age",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_31",
            "name": "gender",
            "is_duplicate": false,
            "group": null
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_32",
            "name": "sex",
            "is_duplicate": false,
            "group": null
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_34",
            "name": "income",
            "is_duplicate": false,
            "group": null
        }
