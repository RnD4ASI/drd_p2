Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine which attributes are duplicates of each other based on their names and definitions. The goal is to group them into duplicates or not, using the same group ID for all duplicates.

First, I need to look at each attribute and see if they represent the same concept. Let's list them out:

1. attr_23: ID (Definition: Given name of the person)
2. attr_24: Name (given_name) (Definition: Forename of the individual)
3. attr_26: Name (surname) (Definition: Surname of the person)
4. attr_27: Name (family_name) (Definition: Family name of the individual)
5. attr_33: Name (gender_identity) (Definition: Gender identity of the individual)
6. attr_35: Name (annual_salary) (Definition: Annual salary of the person)
7. attr_36: Name (yearly_earnings) (Definition: Yearly earnings of the individual)

Now, looking at the definitions, I notice that attributes 2, 4, 6, 7 are related to names or personal information. Let's see:

- attr_23: ID (Given name)
- attr_24: given_name (Forename)
- attr_26: surname (Surname)
- attr_27: family_name (Family name)

Wait, but attr_23's definition is "Given name of the person," which is similar to "forename" in attr_24. So attr_23 and attr_24 might be duplicates. Similarly, attr_26 and attr_27 are surname and family name, which are related. But the definitions here are a bit different. The problem says that duplicates are if they represent the same concept or similar semantic meaning, even if different names or definitions.

So, for example, "given_name" and "forename" are synonyms. Similarly, "surname" and "family_name" are synonyms. So attr_24 and attr_23 are duplicates, and attr_26 and attr_27 are duplicates. But wait, the definitions are different. The problem says that even if the names are different, if they have similar meanings, they are duplicates.

So attr_23 (ID) is a bit confusing. Wait, the ID is attr_23, and the definition is "Given name of the person." Wait, that seems odd. Because ID is usually an identifier, not a name. But maybe in this context, attr_23 is the ID, and the definition is given as "Given name of the person." That seems contradictory. But maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to work with the given data.

But the problem says that the definitions are as given. So attr_23's definition is "Given name of the person," which is a bit odd. But perhaps the user intended that attr_23 is the ID, and the definition is a typo. But regardless, the task is to check if the attributes are duplicates based on their names and definitions.

So, moving on. Let's check each attribute:

- attr_23: ID, definition is given name. But ID is usually an identifier, not a name. However, maybe in this context, attr_23 is the ID, and the definition is a mistake. But the problem says to use the definitions as given. So perhaps attr_23 is a name, but the definition is conflicting. But the user might have intended that attr_23 is the ID, and the definition is a mistake. However, the task is to check duplicates based on the given definitions.

But perhaps the user intended that attr_23 is the ID, and the definition is "Given name of the person," which is not correct. But I have to work with the given data.

So, proceeding. Let's see:

attr_23: ID (given name) â€“ this seems like a mistake, but maybe it's a typo. However, the problem says to use the definitions as given. So perhaps attr_23 is a name, but the definition is incorrect. But the task is to check duplicates based on the definitions.

But maybe the user intended that attr_23 is the ID, and the definition is a mistake. However, the problem says to analyze the attributes and their definitions. So I need to check if any attributes are duplicates based on their names and definitions.

So, looking at the names:

- attr_23: ID
- attr_24: given_name
- attr_26: surname
- attr_27: family_name
- attr_33: gender_identity
- attr_35: annual_salary
- attr_36: yearly_earnings

Now, the definitions:

- attr_23: Given name of the person (but ID is usually an identifier)
- attr_24: Forename of the individual (which is similar to given name)
- attr_26: Surname of the person (which is a family name)
- attr_27: Family name of the individual (same as surname)
- attr_33: Gender identity
- attr_35: Annual salary
- attr_36: Yearly earnings

So, attr_24 and attr_23 are both names, but attr_23's definition is given name, and attr_24's is forename. These are synonyms. So they are duplicates.

Similarly, attr_26 and attr_27 are surname and family name, which are synonyms. So they are duplicates.

Then, attr_35 and attr_36 are annual salary and yearly earnings. These are similar concepts, both referring to the amount earned in a year. So they are duplicates.

attr_33 is gender identity, which is a unique attribute. So it's not a duplicate.

attr_23 and attr_24 are duplicates (group 1), attr_26 and attr_27 are duplicates (group 2), attr_35 and attr_36 are duplicates (group 3). The rest are unique.

But wait, the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So if two attributes are duplicates, they share the same group ID.

So, the duplicates would be:

- attr_23 and attr_24 (group 1)
- attr_26 and attr_27 (group 2)
- attr_35 and attr_36 (group 3)

But wait, the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So each group is a separate group. So the duplicates are three groups.

But the example given in the problem has three attributes with two duplicates. So in the example, two attributes are duplicates in group 1, and the third is not.

So in our case, there are three pairs of duplicates, each in their own group. So the JSON should have three entries in the duplicates array, each with group 1, 2, 3 respectively.

But let me check again.

Wait, the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So if two attributes are duplicates, they are in the same group. So if attr_23 and attr_24 are duplicates, they are in group 1. attr_26 and attr_27 are in group 2. attr_35 and attr_36 are in group 3. So the JSON would have three entries, each with their own group.

But the example shows that if two attributes are duplicates, they are in the same group. So in the example, two attributes are duplicates in group 1, and the third is not. So in our case, three pairs of duplicates, each in their own group.

So the final JSON would be:

{
  "duplicates": [
    {
      "id": "attr_23",
      "name": "ID",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_24",
      "name": "given_name",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_26",
      "name": "surname",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_27",
      "name": "family_name",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_35",
      "name": "annual_salary",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 3
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_36",
      "name": "yearly_earnings",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 3
    }
  ]
}

Wait, but in the example, the group is an integer. So each group is a separate integer. So in this case, the three pairs are in groups 1, 2, 3. So the JSON would have six entries, each with their own group. But the problem says that the group is the same for all duplicates. So if attr_23 and attr_24 are in group 1, then attr_26 and attr_27 are in group 2, and attr_35 and attr_36 in group 3.

But the example shows that the group is the same for all duplicates in the same group. So the JSON should have each duplicate pair in their own group.

But the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So each group is
