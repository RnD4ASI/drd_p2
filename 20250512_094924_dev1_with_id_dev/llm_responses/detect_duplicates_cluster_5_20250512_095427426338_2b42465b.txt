The JSON object should be structured with the following properties:

- "duplicates": an array of objects, each representing a duplicate relationship. Each object must have the following properties:
  - "id": the unique identifier of the attribute (e.g., "attr_1", "attr_2", etc.)
  - "name": the name of the attribute
  - "is_duplicate": a boolean indicating whether the attribute is a duplicate of another
  - "group": an integer group identifier for duplicates. All attributes in the same group are duplicates of each other.

The JSON must be valid and must not contain any additional fields or information.

Now, let's analyze the attributes:

1. ID: attr_4 | Name: transaction_amount | Definition: Amount of the transaction in dollars
2. ID: attr_5 | Name: payment_value | Definition: Value of the payment in dollars
3. ID: attr_6 | Name: monetary_sum | Definition: Sum of money in dollars

Each of these attributes has a definition that is related to the amount of money in dollars. The term "transaction_amount" is a bit more specific, but it's still related to the amount of a transaction. "payment_value" is a direct synonym for the amount of a payment. "monetary_sum" is a general term for the total amount of money. 

All of these attributes are related to the same concept: the amount of money in dollars. They are all used to represent the same value, just with different names and definitions. Therefore, they are duplicates of each other.

So, the duplicates are attr_4, attr_5, and attr_6. They are all duplicates of each other. Therefore, they should be grouped under the same group identifier. The other attributes (none in this case) are not duplicates.
```json
{
    "duplicates": [
        {
            "id": "attr_4",
            "name": "transaction_amount",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_5",
            "name": "payment_value",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_6",
            "name": "monetary_sum",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        }
    ]
}
``` The JSON is valid and correctly identifies that attr_4, attr_5, and attr_6 are duplicates of each other. The group identifier is set to 1 for all three attributes. The other attributes are not duplicates, so their group fields are set to null.
