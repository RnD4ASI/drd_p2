Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine which of the given attributes are duplicates of each other based on their names and definitions. The goal is to group them into duplicates or not, using the same group ID for all duplicates.

First, I'll list out all the attributes and their details:

1. attr_13: ID (Name: email_address, Definition: Email address of the customer)
2. attr_14: ID (Name: contact_email, Definition: Email contact information)
3. attr_15: ID (Name: electronic_mail, Definition: Electronic mail address for communication)
4. attr_16: ID (Name: phone_number, Definition: Phone number of the customer)
5. attr_17: ID (Name: contact_phone, Definition: Phone contact information)
6. attr_18: ID (Name: telephone, Definition: Telephone number for communication)

Now, I need to check if any of these attributes have similar meanings. Let's look at each one's name and definition.

Starting with attr_13: "email_address" is the name, and the definition is "Email address of the customer". So this is about the customer's email.

Then attr_14: "contact_email" with definition "Email contact information". That's similar, but maybe slightly different. The name is "contact_email" which might be more about contact information, but the definition is similar.

attr_15: "electronic_mail" with definition "Electronic mail address for communication". This is very similar to "email_address" but uses "electronic_mail" as the name. The definition is almost the same, just using different terminology.

attr_16: "phone_number" with definition "Phone number of the customer". This is straightforward.

attr_17: "contact_phone" with definition "Phone contact information". Similar to "contact_email", this is about phone contact info.

attr_18: "telephone" with definition "Telephone number for communication". This is a bit more general, but the definition is similar to the others.

Now, looking at the names: email_address, contact_email, electronic_mail, phone_number, contact_phone, telephone. The key here is that all these are related to contact information, either email or phone. The definitions are all about the customer's contact details.

So, the first thing that comes to mind is that attr_13, attr_14, attr_15 are all about email addresses. Similarly, attr_16, attr_17, attr_18 are about phone numbers. But wait, attr_16 is "phone_number" and attr_17 is "contact_phone", attr_18 is "telephone". So phone numbers are different from contact phone, but maybe they are similar.

But the definitions are: phone_number is "Phone number of the customer", contact_phone is "Phone contact information", and telephone is "Telephone number for communication". So phone number is a general term, while contact_phone might be more about the contact information, but the definitions are similar. Similarly, telephone is a general term for a phone number.

So, perhaps all these attributes are duplicates of each other, but grouped into two categories: email addresses and phone numbers.

Wait, but the problem says that duplicates are attributes that represent the same concept or similar semantic meaning. So, if "email_address" and "contact_email" are duplicates, then they should be grouped. Similarly, "electronic_mail" and "email_address" are duplicates. But the names are different, but the definitions are similar.

So, attr_13 (email_address), attr_14 (contact_email), attr_15 (electronic_mail) are all about email addresses. So they are duplicates of each other. Then attr_16 (phone_number), attr_17 (contact_phone), attr_18 (telephone) are about phone numbers, so they are duplicates of each other.

But wait, the problem says that each attribute must be checked against others. So, for example, attr_13 is a duplicate of attr_14, attr_15, etc. Similarly, attr_16 is a duplicate of attr_17 and attr_18.

But the question is, are all these attributes considered duplicates of each other? Let's check.

For example, attr_13 (email_address) and attr_14 (contact_email) are duplicates. Similarly, attr_13 and attr_15 (electronic_mail) are duplicates. So, all three (attr_13, 14, 15) are duplicates of each other. Similarly, attr_16, 17, 18 are duplicates of each other.

So, the duplicates would be:

Group 1: attr_13, attr_14, attr_15 (all email-related)
Group 2: attr_16, attr_17, attr_18 (all phone-related)

But wait, the problem says that each attribute must be checked against others. So, for example, attr_13 is a duplicate of attr_14, attr_15, and attr_16 is a duplicate of attr_17, attr_18. But attr_16 is not a duplicate of attr_13 or attr_14. So, the duplicates would be:

Group 1: attr_13, attr_14, attr_15 (all email-related)
Group 2: attr_16, attr_17, attr_18 (all phone-related)

But the problem says that the group ID must be the same for all duplicates. So, for example, if attr_13 is in group 1, then attr_14, attr_15 are also in group 1. Similarly, attr_16, 17, 18 are in group 2.

So, the JSON structure would have two entries in the duplicates array, each with their group ID.

But wait, the example given in the problem has three attributes with two duplicates. So, in the example, two attributes are duplicates, and the third is not. So, in our case, there are two groups of three attributes each. So, the duplicates array would have two entries, each with group 1 and group 2.

But the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier. So, for each group of duplicates, the group ID is the same. So, for example, if attr_13, 14, 15 are in group 1, then all of them have group 1. Similarly, attr_16, 17, 18 are in group 2.

So, the JSON would look like:

{
  "duplicates": [
    {
      "id": "attr_13",
      "name": "email_address",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_14",
      "name": "contact_email",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_15",
      "name": "electronic_mail",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_16",
      "name": "phone_number",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_17",
      "name": "contact_phone",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_18",
      "name": "telephone",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 2
    }
  ]
}

But wait, the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So, each group is assigned a unique integer. So, in this case, group 1 and group 2 are the two groups. So, the duplicates array has entries for each attribute, and each attribute's group is set to 1 or 2.

But the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So, if two attributes are duplicates, they are in the same group. So, in the example given, two attributes are in group 1, and one in group 2.

But in our case, all three email attributes are in group 1, and all three phone attributes are in group 2. So, the JSON would have six entries in the duplicates array, each with their group.

But the problem says that the duplicates array should have entries for each attribute that is a duplicate. So, for each attribute, if it's a duplicate of another, it's included in the duplicates array. But the group is set to the same group ID for all duplicates.

So, the final JSON would have the six entries as above, with group 1 and 2.

But wait, the problem says that the group is an integer group identifier for duplicates. So, if an attribute is not a duplicate, the group is null. But in this case, all attributes are duplicates, so their group is 1 or 2.

But the example given in the problem has three attributes with two duplicates. So, in the example, two attributes are duplicates, and the third is not. So, in our case, all attributes are duplicates of each other, but grouped into two groups.

Therefore, the JSON should have all six attributes in the duplicates array, each with their group.

But let me check again. Are all the attributes duplicates of each other? For example, attr_13 (email_address) is a duplicate of attr_14 (contact_email), attr
