Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine which of the given attributes are duplicates of each other based on their names and definitions. The attributes are:

1. ID: attr_19 | Name: address | Definition: Physical address of the customer
2. ID: attr_20 | Name: location | Definition: Location of the customer
3. ID: attr_21 | Name: residence | Definition: Place of residence

First, I should look at the definitions. The definitions are about the customer's physical address, location, and place of residence. Now, I need to see if these are similar in meaning. 

The "address" is a general term for a physical location, which is what the "physical address of the customer" refers to. "Location" can be a bit more general, maybe referring to the place where the customer is located, which could be the same as the address. "Residence" is the place where someone lives, which is also a physical address. 

So, "address" and "location" might be duplicates because they both refer to the customer's location. However, "residence" is more specific, like the place where the customer lives, which could be the same as the address. But maybe "location" is a broader term. 

Wait, but the definitions are: "Physical address of the customer" for address, "Location of the customer" for location, and "Place of residence" for residence. So, "residence" is a specific type of location, but maybe the definitions are overlapping. 

So, "address" and "location" might be duplicates. "Residence" is a specific type of location, but maybe it's considered a duplicate of "location" or "address". 

But the problem says to consider if they represent the same concept or similar semantic meaning. So, "address" and "location" are both about the physical location where the customer is. "Residence" is the place where the customer lives, which is a specific type of location. So, "residence" might be a subset of "location" or "address". 

Therefore, "address" and "location" are duplicates, and "residence" is not a duplicate of either. But wait, the problem says to check if any attributes are duplicates of each other. So, if "address" and "location" are duplicates, then they would be in the same group. "Residence" is not a duplicate of any other attribute. 

So, the duplicates would be attr_19 (address) and attr_20 (location), and attr_21 (residence) is not a duplicate. 

But I need to check if "residence" is a duplicate of any other. Since "residence" is a specific type of location, maybe it's considered a duplicate of "location" or "address". But the definitions are "Place of residence" for attr_21. So, if "location" is a broader term, then "residence" might be a subset. Therefore, "residence" is not a duplicate of any other attribute. 

So, the duplicates would be attr_19 and attr_20. Therefore, their group is 1. The third attribute, attr_21, is not a duplicate. 

So the JSON should have two entries: one for attr_19 and attr_20 as duplicates, and attr_21 as not a duplicate. 

Wait, but the problem says to assign the same group ID to all duplicates. So, if attr_19 and attr_20 are duplicates, they are in group 1. attr_21 is not a duplicate, so its group is null. 

Therefore, the final JSON would be:

{
  "duplicates": [
    {
      "id": "attr_19",
      "name": "address",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_20",
      "name": "location",
      "is_duplicate": true,
      "group": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "attr_21",
      "name": "residence",
      "is_duplicate": false,
      "group": null
    }
  ]
}

Yes, that seems right. The key is that "address" and "location" are duplicates, and "residence" is not. So the group for the duplicates is 1, and the third attribute's group is null.
Answer:
```json
{
    "duplicates": [
        {
            "id": "attr_19",
            "name": "address",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_20",
            "name": "location",
            "is_duplicate": true,
            "group": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "attr_21",
            "name": "residence",
            "is_duplicate": false,
            "group": null
        }
    ]
}
```
