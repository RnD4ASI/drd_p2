Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look at the list of attributes provided and see which ones might be duplicates based on their names and definitions. The goal is to determine if any attributes are duplicates of each other, even if they have different names or definitions.

Looking at the attributes:

1. attr_40: ID, Name: attribute_3, Definition: Definition for attribute_3
2. attr_41: ID, Name: attribute_4, Definition: Definition for attribute_4
3. attr_43: ID, Name: attribute_6, Definition: Definition for attribute_6
4. attr_48: ID, Name: attribute_11, Definition: Definition for attribute_11
5. attr_50: ID, Name: attribute_13, Definition: Definition for attribute_13
6. attr_51: ID, Name: attribute_14, Definition: Definition for attribute_14
7. attr_54: ID, Name: attribute_17, Definition: Definition for attribute_17
8. attr_55: ID, Name: attribute_18, Definition: Definition for attribute_18
9. attr_58: ID, Name: attribute_21, Definition: Definition for attribute_21
10. attr_61: ID, Name: attribute_24, Definition: Definition for attribute_24
11. attr_64: ID, Name: attribute_27, Definition: Definition for attribute_27
12. attr_65: ID, Name: attribute_28, Definition: Definition for attribute_28
13. attr_70: ID, Name: attribute_33, Definition: Definition for attribute_33
14. attr_79: ID, Name: attribute_42, Definition: Definition for attribute_42
15. attr_80: ID, Name: attribute_43, Definition: Definition for attribute_43
16. attr_83: ID, Name: attribute_46, Definition: Definition for attribute_46
17. attr_86: ID, Name: attribute_49, Definition: Definition for attribute_49
18. attr_90: ID, Name: attribute_53, Definition: Definition for attribute_53
19. attr_91: ID, Name: attribute_54, Definition: Definition for attribute_54
20. attr_99: ID, Name: attribute_62, Definition: Definition for attribute_62
21. attr_100: ID, Name: attribute_63, Definition: Definition for attribute_63

Now, I need to check if any of these attributes have similar names or definitions. Let's go through them one by one.

Looking at the names:

- attr_40: ID, Name: attribute_3
- attr_41: ID, Name: attribute_4
- attr_43: ID, Name: attribute_6
- attr_48: ID, Name: attribute_11
- attr_50: ID, Name: attribute_13
- attr_51: ID, Name: attribute_14
- attr_54: ID, Name: attribute_17
- attr_55: ID, Name: attribute_18
- attr_58: ID, Name: attribute_21
- attr_61: ID, Name: attribute_24
- attr_64: ID, Name: attribute_27
- attr_65: ID, Name: attribute_28
- attr_70: ID, Name: attribute_33
- attr_79: ID, Name: attribute_42
- attr_80: ID, Name: attribute_43
- attr_83: ID, Name: attribute_46
- attr_86: ID, Name: attribute_49
- attr_90: ID, Name: attribute_53
- attr_91: ID, Name: attribute_54
- attr_99: ID, Name: attribute_62
- attr_100: ID, Name: attribute_63

Wait, I notice that attr_80 and attr_83 have the same name "attribute_43" and "attribute_46" respectively. But looking at the names, attr_80 is "attribute_43" and attr_83 is "attribute_46". So they are different. But maybe there's a pattern here. Let me check again.

Wait, the names are:

- attr_40: attribute_3
- attr_41: attribute_4
- attr_43: attribute_6
- attr_48: attribute_11
- attr_50: attribute_13
- attr_51: attribute_14
- attr_54: attribute_17
- attr_55: attribute_18
- attr_58: attribute_21
- attr_61: attribute_24
- attr_64: attribute_27
- attr_65: attribute_28
- attr_70: attribute_33
- attr_79: attribute_42
- attr_80: attribute_43
- attr_83: attribute_46
- attr_86: attribute_49
- attr_90: attribute_53
- attr_91: attribute_54
- attr_99: attribute_62
- attr_100: attribute_63

Looking at the attribute numbers, the names are attribute_3, attribute_4, attribute_6, attribute_11, attribute_13, attribute_14, attribute_17, attribute_18, attribute_21, attribute_24, attribute_27, attribute_28, attribute_33, attribute_42, attribute_43, attribute_46, attribute_49, attribute_53, attribute_54, attribute_62, attribute_63.

Wait, but the names are all different. So each attribute has a unique name. But the problem says that two attributes are duplicates if they represent the same concept or similar semantic meaning. So even if the names are different, if they have the same meaning, they are duplicates.

But looking at the names, they are all different. For example, attribute_3, attribute_4, attribute_6, etc. So unless there's a pattern in the numbers, they might not be duplicates. However, the definitions might be similar. Let me check the definitions.

The definitions are:

1. Definition for attribute_3
2. Definition for attribute_4
3. Definition for attribute_6
4. Definition for attribute_11
5. Definition for attribute_13
6. Definition for attribute_14
7. Definition for attribute_17
8. Definition for attribute_18
9. Definition for attribute_21
10. Definition for attribute_24
11. Definition for attribute_27
12. Definition for attribute_28
13. Definition for attribute_33
14. Definition for attribute_42
15. Definition for attribute_43
16. Definition for attribute_46
17. Definition for attribute_49
18. Definition for attribute_53
19. Definition for attribute_54
20. Definition for attribute_62
21. Definition for attribute_63

Wait, the definitions are all different. So the only thing that's common is that each attribute has a definition. But the names are all unique. So unless there's a hidden pattern, I don't see any duplicates here.

Wait, but maybe the attributes are numbered in a way that they are related. For example, attribute_3, attribute_4, attribute_6, etc. But they are all different. So maybe there are no duplicates here. But the problem says to check if they are duplicates based on semantic meaning.

Alternatively, maybe the attributes are part of a larger system where some attributes are duplicates. For example, if "attribute_3" and "attribute_4" are both related to the same concept, but their names are different. But in the given data, the names are all unique. So unless there's a hidden relationship, I don't see duplicates.

Wait, but looking at the IDs: attr_40, attr_41, etc. The IDs are unique. So each attribute has a unique ID. The names are unique as well. The definitions are unique. So there's no duplication in the attributes based on the given data.

Therefore, the answer would be that there are no duplicates. So each attribute's is_duplicate is false, and group is null.

But wait, the problem says "analyze the following attributes and identify which ones are duplicates of each other." So if there are no duplicates, then the duplicates array would be empty. But the example shows that if there are duplicates, they are in the duplicates array. So in this case, since there are no duplicates, the duplicates array is empty.

But the user's example shows that if there are duplicates, they are in the array. So the final answer would be a JSON object with an
